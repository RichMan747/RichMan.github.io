Github account created, by Richard Hew, for accessing the Github respository.
Github Respository created, by Richard Hew, for completing and commiting on future assignments. 
I first created the original repository. I then opened the GitHub Desktop where I proceeded to click the button "Clone Repository." I copied the original repository URL and selected where I wanted the files to go. I then cloned the repository into my local machine.
